# Trash-TML: A Messy Mix of Experimental Web Dev Code

Welcome to the Trash-TML repository, a collection of experimental web development code snippets, debugging trials, and UI experiments. This project is a part of my learning journey, and the purpose of this repository is to document and share my progress in web development.

## Description

Trash-TML is a messy mix of various web development code snippets, debugging trials, and UI experiments. The code in this repository is not organized or structured in any particular way, and it may contain errors, incomplete code, or unfinished projects. The goal is to provide a collection of code that can be used as a reference, inspiration, or starting point for your own projects.
